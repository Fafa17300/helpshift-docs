# Helpshift APIs <small>iOS</small> {#support-tools}

<Intro>

Helpshift provides a way to use each functional element of the SDK separately based on your requirements.
You can call only specific screens from the SDK based on the
functionality you want to expose in your app.

</Intro>

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

All the public APIs in the SDK should be called after initializing the SDK via [HelpshiftSdk.install() API](/sdkx-unity/getting-started-ios#initializing)

## Integrating Contact Us & In App Messaging {#conversation-view}

<Centered width="major">

![newConversation.png](/static/books/sdkx_ios/Show-Conversation.png "Show-Conversation.png")

</Centered>

You can use the API call `ShowConversation(configMap)` to allow a user to directly send feedback or start a new conversation without having to first view FAQs. Once, a user starts a new conversation, this API call will show the conversation screen. The conversation will continue until it is resolved or rejected by the agent.

To configure the conversation screen, you can pass various config options in a `Dictionary<string, object>`. Checkout more config options [here](/sdkx-unity/sdk-configuration-ios)

Example :

```csharp
using Helpshift;

private HelpshiftSdk help;

// install call here
void Awake(){
    help = HelpshiftSdk.GetInstance();
    help.Install(appId, domainName, null);
}

// configuration map
Dictionary<string, object> configMap = new Dictionary<string, object>
        {
            { "tags", new String[] { "foo", "bar" } },
        };

// open the support chat screen
help.ShowConversation(configMap);
```

## Integrating FAQs {#faqs-view}

<Centered >

<Image src="/static/books/sdkx_ios/show_faqs.png" width="full" />{" "}

</Centered>

You can use the API call `ShowFAQs(configMap)` to provide a way for the user to invoke the purpose-built help/support section in your app. This is the easiest approach to enable help in your app as it bundles all the capabilities of the Helpshift SDK in a simple and intuitive interface. You can wire this API call to a **"Help"** or **"Support"** action in your app.

To configure the FAQs screen, you can pass various config options in a `Dictionary<string, object>`. Checkout more config options [here](/sdkx-unity/sdk-configuration-ios)

Example :

```csharp
using Helpshift;

private HelpshiftSdk help;

// install call here
void Awake(){
    help = HelpshiftSdk.GetInstance();
    help.Install(appId, domainName, null);
}

// configuration map
Dictionary<string, object> configMap = new Dictionary<string, object>
        {
            { "tags", new String[] { "foo", "bar" } },
        };

// open the FAQs screen
help.ShowFAQs(configMap);
```

## Showing a Particular FAQ Section {#faq-section-view}

<Centered >

<Image src="/static/books/sdkx_ios/show_section.png" width="full" />{" "}

</Centered>

You can use the API call `ShowFAQSection(sectionId, configMap)` to invoke a particular section of your FAQs with its FAQ section publish-id

This feature works like a permalink for displaying specific FAQ sections as context sensitive help in your app. For example, if your app requires the user to login to using email, facebook and twitter, you could wire a help action on the login screen that can link to the Helpshift FAQ section called "Login help" which has several questions related to login methods.

Example :

```csharp
using Helpshift;

private HelpshiftSdk help;

// install call here
void Awake(){
    help = HelpshiftSdk.GetInstance();
    help.Install(appId, domainName, null);
}

// configuration map
Dictionary<string, object> configMap = new Dictionary<string, object>
        {
            { "tags", new String[] { "foo", "bar" } },
        };

string sectionId = "your_section_id";

// open the particular section
help.ShowFAQSection(sectionId,configMap);
```
### FAQ Filtering by tags {#faq-filtering}

Starting v4.14.0 onwards, we have introduced FAQ filtering capability by tags.
With the goal of helping the end user see focused & related content e.g. basis the user demographic or device profiles, developers can now choose the new capability for FAQ filtering and showing a focused FAQ list to the right audience.

Typical cases why you would want to use FAQ filtering are :

- You want to show specific FAQs for specific audience. E.g. if you may categorize the users as ‘beginner’, ‘intermediate’ or ‘expert’ based on your business logic.
- You may want to show specific FAQs based on the device. E.g. a set of FAQs for iPad vs. iPhone.

FAQ filtering is a 2 step approach :

1. FAQs need to be classified using the `<issue tags>` field on the dashboard e.g. tags `iphone` & `ipad`.
   <Image src="/static/books/ios/faq-filtering.png" width="full" />{" "}
2. Once the FAQs are tagged, they can be filtered at the SDK using the filter options described here.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Helpshift has 2 types of tags mainly ‘Issue Tags’ & ‘Search Tags’.

- Issue tags are used to filter the FAQ list on the SDK with the filter rules.
- Search tags (a.k.a Search Keywords) When performing in-app search, Helpshift SDK gives preference to these keywords. You can also use this to add alternative keywords that users might search for, but which may not exist in the FAQ title or the content.

</Admonition>

#### How to use FAQ filtering

This will be a config option which will be supported by the showFAQs and showFAQSection APIs.

The withTagsMatching option will be a dictionary containing 2 keys

- operator : one of and, or, not which will serve as conditional operators for the given tags.
- tags : the actual tags in the query

The withTagsMatching option will be should be added as an object against key “withTagsMatching ” in the dictionary optionsDictionary that is taken by showFAQs and showFAQSection APIs.

<TabItem value="Using Api Config object" label="Using Api Config object">

```objc

	//If the developer wants to show all FAQs with tags iPad or iPhone
	HelpshiftAPIConfigBuilder *apiBuilder = [[HelpshiftAPIConfigBuilder alloc] init];
	apiBuilder.withTagsMatching = [[HelpshiftFAQFilter alloc] initWithFilterOperator:HsOperatorOr / HsOperatorAnd / HsOperatorNot andTags:@[@"tag1",@"tag2",...]];
	HelpshiftAPIConfig *apiConfigObject = [apiBuilder build];
	[HelpshiftSupport showFAQs:self withConfig:apiConfigObject];

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Using Dictionary" label="Using Dictionary">

```objc

	//If the developer wants to show all FAQs with tags iPad or iPhone
	NSDictionary * optionsDictionary = @{ @"withTagsMatching" : @{ @"operator" : @"or",
                                                                   @"tags" : @[@"iPhone",@"iPad"]}};
	[HelpshiftSupport showFAQs:self withOptions:optionsDictionary];

```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

As of v4.14.0 you can have only one tag filter config which will be respected on showFAQs and showFAQSection. Also the tag filtering respects only one operator.

</Admonition>

## Showing a Particular FAQ {#faq-view}

<Centered >

<Image src="/static/books/sdkx_ios/show_single_faq.png" width="full" />{" "}

</Centered>

You can use the API `ShowSingleFAQ(faqId,configMap)` to show a single FAQ. You will need to pass the `publish-id` of the FAQ to be shown to this API.

Example :

```csharp
using Helpshift;

private HelpshiftSdk help;

// install call here
void Awake(){
    help = HelpshiftSdk.GetInstance();
    help.Install(appId, domainName, null);
}

// configuration map
Dictionary<string, object> configMap = new Dictionary<string, object>
        {
            { "tags", new String[] { "foo", "bar" } },
        };

string faqId = "your_faq_id";

// open the particular FAQ
help.ShowSingleFAQ(faqId,configMap);
```

### Set SDK language {#set-language-api}

You can set the SDK language for the given locale using the method `SetLanguage("<language-code>")`
For more info about languages you can refer [here](/sdkx-unity/i18n-ios/)

For example :

Setting SDK language for the given locale with only language code.

```csharp
HelpshiftSdk.GetInstance().SetLanguage("fr");
```

Setting the SDK language for the given locale with both language code and country code.

```csharp
HelpshiftSdk.GetInstance().SetLanguage("zh-SG");
```
