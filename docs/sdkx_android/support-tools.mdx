# Helpshift APIs {#support-tools}

<Intro>

Helpshift provides a way to use functional element of the SDK based on your requirements.

</Intro>

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

All the public APIs in the SDK should be called after initializing the SDK via [Helpshift.install() API](/sdkx_android/getting-started#start-using)

</Admonition>

## Integrating Contact Us & In App Messaging {#conversation-view}

You can call `Helpshift.showConversation(MyActivity.this, configurationMap)` to allow a user to directly send feedback or start a new conversation without having to first view FAQs. Once user starts a new conversation, this API call will show the conversation screen. The conversation will continue until it is resolved or rejected by the agent.

<Centered width="major">

</Centered>

Example:

```java
	// config map
	Map<String, Object> config = new HashMap<>();

    // set tags for tracking
    config.put("tags", new String[]{"foo", "bar"});

    // set custom issue fields
    Map<String, Object> cifMap = new HashMap<>();
    Map<String, String> isPro = new HashMap<>();
    isPro.put("type", "boolean");
    isPro.put("value", "true");
    cifMap.put("is_pro", isPro);

    config.put("cifs", cifMap);

    //..etc

    // pass the config map in the api
    Helpshift.showConversation(MainActivity.this, config);
```

<CustomIssueFieldsKeyDeprecationNotice />

`Helpshift.showConversation(MyActivity.this, configMap);` where `MyActivity.this` is the Activity you're calling Helpshift from and `configMap` is the configuration map that you want to pass to configure the SDK.

Supports these [API Options](/sdkx_android/sdk-configuration/).

## Integrating FAQs {#faqs-view}

You can use the API call `Helpshift.showFAQs(Activity a, Map<String, Object> configMap)` to provide a way for the user to invoke the purpose built help/support section in your app. This is the easiest approach to enable help in your app as it bundles all the capabilities of the Helpshift SDK in a simple and intuitive interface. You can wire this api call to a **"Help"** or **"Support"** action in your app.

<Centered >

![showFAQs.png](/static/books/sdkx_android/show_faqs.png "showFAQs.png")

</Centered>

This Activity combines the FAQ, Search and Contact Us functionality together in a single interface. In this view, a user can search for a specific question in the FAQ failing which they can report an issue. When you respond back to their question from the Helpshift Agent Dashboard, the reply will be shown as a count besides Contact Us, clicking on which will open up the conversation.

Example:
`Helpshift.showFAQs(MyActivity.this, configMap);` where `MyActivity.this` is the Activity you're calling Helpshift from and `configMap` is the configuration map that you want to pass to configure the SDK.

Supports these [API Options](/sdkx_android/sdk-configuration/).

### FAQ Filtering by tags {#faq-filtering}

Starting v3.11.0 onwards, we have introduced FAQ filtering capability by tags. With the goal of helping the end user see focused & related content e.g. basis the user demographic or device profiles, developers can now choose the new capability for FAQ filtering and showing a focused FAQ list to the right audience.
Typical cases why you would want to use FAQ filtering are :

- You want to show specific FAQs for specific audience. E.g. if you may categorize the users as ‘beginner’, ‘intermediate’ or ‘expert’ based on your business logic
- You may want to show specific FAQs based on the device. E.g. a set of FAQs for Tablet vs. Phone

FAQ filtering is a 2 step approach

1. FAQs need to be classified using the issue tags field on the dashboard e.g. tags ‘phone’ & ‘tablet’.
   <Image src="/static/books/android/faq-filtering.png" width="full" />{" "}
2. Once the FAQs are tagged, they can be filtered at the SDK using the filter options described here.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Helpshift has 2 types of tags mainly `Issue Tags` & `Search Tags`.

- Issue tags are used to filter the FAQ list on the SDK with the filter rules.
- Search tags (a.k.a Search Keywords) When performing in-app search, Helpshift SDK gives preference to these keywords. You can also use this to add alternative keywords that users might search for, but which may not exist in the FAQ title or the content.

</Admonition>

#### How to use FAQ filtering

This will be a config option which will be supported by the showFAQs and showFAQSection APIs.

Usage :

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="Using ApiConfig" label="Using ApiConfig">

```java

    String operator = FaqTagFilter.Operator.AND / FaqTagFilter.Operator.OR / FaqTagFilter.Operator.NOT;
    String[] filterTags = new String[]{"tag1", "tag2"};
    FaqTagFilter faqTagFilter = new FaqTagFilter(operator, filterTags);
    ApiConfig apiConfig = new ApiConfig.Builder()
                           .setWithTagsMatching(faqTagFilter)
                           .build();

```

The `withTagsMatching` option will take a FaqTagFilter object which takes two parameters

- operator : one of `FaqTagFilter.Operator.AND`, `FaqTagFilter.Operator.OR`, `FaqTagFilter.Operator.NOT` which will serve as conditional operators for the given tags (String).
- tags : the actual tags in the query (String Array)

Example :

```java

    //If the developer wants to show all FAQs with tags “android-phone” or “android-tablet”
    String operator = FaqTagFilter.Operator.OR;
    String[] filterTags = new String[]{"android-phone", "android-tablet"};
    FaqTagFilter faqTagFilter = new FaqTagFilter(operator, filterTags);
    ApiConfig apiConfig = new ApiConfig.Builder()
                           .setWithTagsMatching(faqTagFilter)
                           .build();
    Support.showFAQs(MyActivity.this, apiConfig);

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Using Map" label="Using Map">

```java

    HashMap<String, Object> map = new HashMap<>();
    String operator = "and/or/not";
    String[] filterTags = new String[]{"tag1", "tag2"};
    map.put("operator", operator);
    map.put("tags", filterTags);
    HashMap config = new HashMap();
    config.put("withTagsMatching", map);

```

The `withTagsMatching` option will be a HashMap containing 2 keys

- operator : one of “and”, “or”, “not” which will serve as conditional operators for the given tags (String).
- tags : the actual tags in the query (String Array)

Example :

```java

    //If the developer wants to show all FAQs with tags “android-phone” or “android-tablet”
    HashMap<String, Object> map = new HashMap<>();
    String operator = "or";
    String[] filterTags = new String[]{"android-phone", "android-tablet"};
    map.put("operator", operator);
    map.put("tags", filterTags);
    HashMap config = new HashMap();
    config.put("withTagsMatching", map);
    Support.showFAQs(MyActivity.this, config);

```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Showing a Particular FAQ Section {#faq-section-view}

You can use the API call
`Helpshift.showFAQSection(Activity a, String sectionPublishId,  Map<String, Object> configMap)` to show FAQs from a particular FAQ section.

<Centered >

![showFAQSection.png](/static/books/sdkx_android/show_section.png "showFAQSection.png")

</Centered>

**You will need the `publish-id` of the FAQ section to use this API:**

<Image src="/static/books/misc/section-publish-id.png" width="full" />{" "}

This feature works like a permalink for displaying specific FAQ sections as context sensitive help in your app. For example, if your app requires the user to login to using email, facebook and twitter, you could wire a help action on the login screen that can link to the Helpshift FAQ section called "Login help" which has several questions related to login methods.

Example:
`Helpshift.showFAQSection(MyActivity.this, "11", configMap);` where `MyActivity.this` is the Activity you're calling Helpshift from and "11" is the FAQ section `publish-id`

Supports these [API Options](/sdkx_android/sdk-configuration/).

## Showing a Particular FAQ {#faq-question-view}

You can use the API call `Helpshift.showSingleFAQ(Activity a, String questionPublishId,  Map<String, Object> configMap)` to show a single FAQ.

<Centered >

![showSingleFAQ.png](/static/books/sdkx_android/show_single_faq.png "showSingleFAQ.png")

</Centered>

**You'll need the `publish-id` of the FAQ to use this API:**

<Image src="/static/books/misc/faq-publish-id.png" width="full" />{" "}

Example: `Helpshift.showSingleFAQ(MyActivity.this, "51", configMap);` where `MyActivity.this` is the Activity you're calling Helpshift from and "51" is the FAQ publish-id.

Supports these [API Options](/sdkx_android/sdk-configuration/).

## Set SDK language {#set-language-api}

You can set the SDK language using the `setLanguage("<language-code>")` API. By default, the device's preferred language is used by the SDK. The call will fail in the following cases:

- If a Helpshift session is already active at the time of invocation
- Language code is incorrect

For more info about languages you can refer [here](/sdkx_android/i18n/).

For example :

Setting SDK language for the given locale with only language code.

```.java
Helpshift.setLanguage("fr");
```

Setting the SDK language for the given locale with both language code and country code.

```.java
Helpshift.setLanguage("zh-SG");
```
